- 👋 Hi, I’m @VladAndreiToma or just simply Vlad
- 👀 I’m interested in theoretical/experimental physics and also different kinds of programming
- 🌱 I’m currently mastering: React.js Vue.js , JavaSript , TypeScript , Node.js , Express.js , Servers , Linux systems. To construct fullstack applications used in science and data analytics.
- Python used in scientific computing, parallel programming, clusterization, deployed automated job , DAQ system automatization , automated analysis , machine learning and large language models processing.
- ROOT & Geant4 by CERN - Simulations in physics and high performance Data Analysis.
- Keen interest in Docker&Kubernetes for CI/CD deployments, controlling grafana dashboards for data visualization and databases.
- Interest in embedded system, automatization of FPGA signal generations to control/emulate experiments events in Physics
- Working with embedded systems: CAEN modules , MesyTec modules , Microx and Pfeiffer Concentration/Vacuum Monitoring Systems. Custom serial communications provided to get and set data according to different producers protocols.
- Working on gas systems, vacuum systems and RF carpets, for Ion transportation and collection.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on scientific computations and ML/AI architectures or DevOps.
- Advanced computational deployments for improving data acquistion tools in research.
- Currently learning: Java and Django
